<h1>hello this is about beetlebob...</h1>

<p>
    beetlebob is the moniker under which i put out all of my doodles. this has been something that is long in the making and yet still very nascent. beetlebob is a doodler, a story teller, a character, a reflection of me and a reflection of the world around me. so i guess until i figure that out, i am just going to keep drawing and making things because it is the closest thing that gets to magic for me in this world. 
    hopefully you have enjoyed the flipping through my doodles (on here or on instagram) and thank you for your support/interest/comments/love. if you like my work and want to work together, hit me up at debbietingw2@gmail.com and let's chat
    thanks!
